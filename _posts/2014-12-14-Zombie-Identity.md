In the pilot episode of *The Walking Dead*, we are introduced to Morgan (played by Lennie James). At one point in the episode, as Rick (Andrew Lincoln) looks out the peephole of Morgan's front door, we see Morgan's wife - or former wife - who is now a walker.

Morgan reveals to Rick that he had a chance to kill his wife, after she was bitten, but was unable to do so because "she is the mother of my child". But we may reasonably ask: **is that being (the walker) the mother of Morgan's child?**

More generally, throughout *The Walking Dead* and other zombie movies and shows we are find people dealing with this philosophical question: are the zombie versions of my friends my friends? Or does my friend cease to be when they become a zombie?

<!-- more -->

This is one of those issues we ought to figure out before we find ourselves in the post-apocalyptic hellscape. For even though we may kill the being in question whether it is our friend or not (it is trying to eat our brains after all) if we are not convinced it is not our friend, we may pause before acting and that pause may be the difference between life and death (or life and zombie-life...)

Let us focus in on Morgan and his wife. The question we are asking is: **is the zombie-version of Morgan's wife actually Morgan's wife?** To clarify this question a bit further, what we are asking is the following:

> Is the zombie-wife **identical** to the wife?

To answer this question we have to dig into a deep philosophical issue: what makes us the same through time? Often I am willing to sacrifice some short term benefit (or accept some short term harm) because I believe doing so will lead to some larger benefit *for me* in the future. Thus, I am assuming that the future being that people call 'Marcus' is identical with the current being that people call 'Marcus'.

#### Bodily Identity ####
To decide whether or not the zombie is identical with the prior being, we should begin with the common way we identify people.

Most often when I am introduced to someone and then see them later, I judge whether or not they are the same person by their appearance. Of course the appearance doesn't have to be exactly the same - they can change their hair, get tanner or paler, wear different clothes, etc. - but if I am unable to match up any physical features I am unlikely to think they are the same person. Similarly, if some person looks sufficiently like someone else I am likely to think they are that other person, at least initially.

So, we most commonly identify people by their body. Call this the  **Bodily Criterion of Identity**.

If we were to apply the Bodily Criterion to the zombie, what would we have to conclude? 

While some may note the decaying flesh, or missing limbs as reasons that the person is different, remember that the bodily criterion does not require everything to be *exactly* the same. Think about yourself as a baby and yourself now - presumably you look significantly different and yet you think are identical to that baby - that the baby was you. Similarly, if you were to have an arm amputated, or were to contract necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease), presumably you do not think this would make you a completely different person.

Thus, I would suggest that the zombie outside Morgan's house is indeed Morgan's wife - the mother of his child. In killing her he would indeed be killing the mother of his child, and thus perhaps he ought to refrain from killing her (given that, as the story goes, she is not particularly a threat to him or his son anymore).

Of course this is only true if the bodily criterion of identity is correct. Although we often use the bodily criterion to identify people, perhaps that is just a generally useful guide and not actually what makes a person identical through time.

#### Mental Criterion of Identity ####
There is some good reason to doubt that the bodily criterion of identity is anything more than a generally useful guide - that in fact it is not the continuity of our body that makes us identical through time.

One reason to doubt this is that there seems to be  **nothing** that remains the same between my baby body and my elderly body. There is continuity (my pieces change gradually rather than all being replaced at once) but nothing the same.

Moreover, although it is true that we often initially identify people based on their appearances, we know that sometimes that is insufficient.

Imagine there are two identical twins - Bill and Will. Bill and Will are tricksters who often like to pass themselves off as the other twin. They look so much alike that if we were to rely on appearance we would be unable to tell them apart. So how might we go about distinguishing them?

One way would be to ask whichever one is in front of us a question that we have reason to believe only one of them knows the answer to. Perhaps we had a particular conversation with Bill, but not Will, and thus we ask about that conversation. If the person can properly answer, then we are likely satisfied that the person is Bill. If they cannot, then we may believe we are speaking to Will.

In such a case we are appealing to the person's *memories*. Call this the  **Mental Criterion of Identity**. On this view, what makes a person identical through time is that (s)he has memories of doing the things that the person in the past actually did.

If we apply this criterion of identity to Morgan's zombie-wife, would we conclude that she is the mother of his child? The issue is a bit tricky here, although this may just be due to an inconsistency in *The Walking Dead* show.

For we are first introduced to Morgan's zombie-wife when Rick sees her out the peephole and at that time she walks up to the house and just hangs around for a bit. No other zombie is really doing this, and no noise was made, and so it seems like the only reason she may have for doing this is because she has some connection to this house. That may very well display some continuity of memory, and thus that the zombie-wife is the mother of his child.

However, in the final episode of season 1, Dr. Jenner of the CDC shows Rick and the gang a playback of someone 'dying' and coming back as a zombie. As he explains the situation, everything that made them who they were - including specifically their memories - is gone, for only their brain stem is reignited.

If Dr. Jenner is correct, then we could agree with him that a zombie incarnation of a person we once knew is not in fact identical to that person prior to their temporary 'death'.
