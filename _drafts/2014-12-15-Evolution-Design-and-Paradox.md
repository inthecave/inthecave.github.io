In reading David P. Barash's book [*Buddhist Biology*](http://amzn.to/1yWLmeW "Amazon.com: Buddhist Biology"), I came across this quotation from George Levine:

> [In a Darwinian world] [w]hat is stable is in motion; what is enormous depends on minutiae; what seems peaceful is at war; struggle is often mutual dependency; lowly worms create the large green expanses of England; six thousand years is no time at all;... if unchecked by natural selection, even slow-breeding elephants would entirely cover the earth within five centuries; there are woodpeckers living where not a tree grows; there are web-footed birds that never go near the water; we are related physiologically to all living things, not only apes but to barnacles and spiders. ... The world of brilliant adaptation is moved not by a creative intelligence but by "unknown laws of nature," and in nature itself the only intelligence is that of organisms, and most obviously and particularly humans. (Levine, [*Darwin the Writer*](http://amzn.to/1ur0ieZ "Amazon.com: Darwin the Writer") (2011))

Food for thought in the push to understand the universe. On one hand, those who wish to deny the truth of evolution by natural selection may object that such "brilliant adaptation" as we see in the world could not come about absent intelligent design and that a world that is the result of chance and "unknown laws of nature" is lacking something.

On the other hand, often many scientists and philosophers insist on understanding the universe logically. But logic has little place for paradox.

What reflection on the natural world shows us is twofold: that there is more to the universe than mere logic - that perhaps our universe does involve real paradoxes; and that we should be in awe of our complex and amazing universe especially because it is not the result of an intelligence.
